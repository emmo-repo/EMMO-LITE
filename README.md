# EMMO-LITE
An unthreatening version of EMMO, populated with easy to use concepts requiring no specific physics or phylosophical expertise, especially designed for rapid development and deployment of ontologies for graph databases using OWL 2 EL expressivity.

EMMO-LITE comes with a mapping with the full EMMO OWL 2 DL version, in case the users want to expand the expressivity of its ontologies or to refer to the content of other existing EMMO based domain ontologies.
